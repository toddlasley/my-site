<p>Prior to coming to Louisville, I lived in Hawesville, a small rural town in western Kentucky. 
    But I am a University of Louisville graduate, having obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer 
    Information Systems in December of 2016. In my spare time, I enjoy working out, good bourbon, 
    football, gaming, and furthering my software development career.</p>
