<p>Prior to coming to Louisville, I lived in Hawesville, a small rural town in western Kentucky, but I am currently a senior at the University of Louisville pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems. As of now, I am scheduled to receive my degree in December of 2016. I currently work as an IT Intern at SWH Supply Company, a local HVAC parts wholesaler, in Louisville, KY. I am also a member of the Iota-Omicron of Sigma Pi Fraternity on the University of Louisville's campus.</p>
