<p>Prior to coming to Louisville, I lived in Hawesville, a small rural town in western Kentucky, but I am currently a senior at the University of Louisville pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems. As of now, I am scheduled to receive my degree in December of 2016. I currently work as an Applications Developer at United Parcel Service, specifically at the Worldport in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
