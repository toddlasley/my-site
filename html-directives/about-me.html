<p>Prior to coming to Louisville, I lived in Hawesville, a small rural town in western Kentucky, but I am a graduate of the University of Louisville with a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems. I currently work as an Applications Developer at United Parcel Service, specifically at the Worldport in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
