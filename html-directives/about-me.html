<p>Prior to coming to Louisville, I lived in Hawesville, a small rural town in western Kentucky, but I am a University of Louisville graduate, having obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems in December of 2016. I currently work as a Support Developer at Bastian Solutions, and in my spare time, I enjoy working out, good bourbon, football, and gaming.</p>
